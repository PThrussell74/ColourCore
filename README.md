# ColourCore
The repository for the game ColourCore:TWICE
The main reason for this repository's existence is to chart and plan the design for the aforementioned game.

Note: Planning on GitHub has been put on hiatus due to incompatabilities. The game itself has not been put on hiatus and is still being developed, shared and tested in a small test group.
